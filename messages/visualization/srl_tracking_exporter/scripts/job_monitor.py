Waits for one or multiple nodes to finish processing (which is reported by calling a service method),
then this node kills itself. This is useful in a ROS launch file to quit the entire launch script if
required processing is finished (by setting required=true on node_monitor).

Parameters:
 _count (int):    Number of jobs to wait for.
